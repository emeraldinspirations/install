# install
The applications and respective configuration files that I have on my personal machine

In order to clone the files from the repo, run the following script replacing [app] with the app desired:

```shell
git clone -o gitHub -b [app] --single-branch git@github.com:emeraldinspirations/install.git ~/Install/[app]
```

Here are the apps I install, ordered (partially) by how I install them.
- [nodejs](https://github.com/emeraldinspirations/install/blob/nodejs/README.md)
- [ionic](https://github.com/emeraldinspirations/install/blob/ionic/README.md)
