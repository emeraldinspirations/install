Apply Ubuntu Fix
----------------

I reinstalled mongod-org, since my data will still stay safe.

The problem was that my system couldn't find mongod.service when I ran sudo
service mongod status.

Running this fixed it and restored the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```

Then all I had to do was copy my correct config to `/etc/mongod.conf` and run

```bash
sudo service mongod restart
```
